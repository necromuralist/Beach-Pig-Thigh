* Introduction

This is a variant of the built-in ~doc~ shortcode (although it seems to go into the plugins folder for some reason, I'll have to look into that). The ReStructured Text ~doc~ documentation says that you can pass in text to display instead of the title of the post it's linking to, but I couldn't get it to work with the non-RST version so I adapted it so I could use it in org-mode posts. I didn't really look too closely at the code, just enough to get it working so it's probably pretty fragile.

"""Shortcode for non-restructured text inter-site links.
Re-write of the ``doc`` plugin to allow alternative titles outside of RST
The documentation seems to indicate that this should work but it uses angle
brackets <> and something is converting them to less than and greater
than HTML symbols.
