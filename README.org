#+TITLE Nikola Helpers Readme (if you want)

These are pieces of code that I use with [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]]. I use Nikola but haven't really studied it so there are probably better ways to do most of these things, but these seem to work well enough.

 - psedocode.tmpl: This adds the mathjax 2 version of [[https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/pseudocode.js][pseudocode.js]]. It ignores the configurations in the ~conf.py~ file at the moment.
 - lancelot/: This is a shortcode plugin that is basically the same as the ~doc~ shortcode but lets me pass in alternate text to use, even though I'm using org-mode, not RST.

The ~pseudocode.tmpl~ is based on ~mako~, not ~jinja~.
